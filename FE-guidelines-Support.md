## Support and Optimization
It's important to recognize the difference between ["support" and "optimization"](http://bradfrost.com/blog/mobile/support-vs-optimization/). You should do your best to support as many environments as possible while simultaneously optimizing for the environments that make the most sense for your business and users.

- **What browsers are you *optimizing* for?**
- **What devices are you *optimizing* for?**
- **Are you using a [graded browser support](https://github.com/yui/yui3/wiki/Graded-Browser-Support) system?**
- **Are there specific components that require [more specific grading](https://www.filamentgroup.com/lab/grade-the-components.html)?**
