### JavaScript Principles
- **What are some general principles your team should follow when writing JavaScript?** *(See [these](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript) [resources](https://github.com/rwaldron/idiomatic.js) for [inspiration](https://github.com/styleguide/javascript))*


### JavaScript tools
- **Are you using a JavaScript framework** *(such as [jQuery](http://jquery.com/), [Ember](http://emberjs.com/), [Angular](https://angularjs.org/), etc)*?
- **Where is the documentation for those frameworks?**
- **Are you using any polyfills or shims** *(such as [any of these](https://github.com/Modernizr/Modernizr/wiki/HTML5-Cross-Browser-Polyfills))*?
- **What third-party scripts are dependencies for your project** *(such as scripts for form validation, graphs, animation, etc)*?

### JavaScript Style

## Support and Optimization
It's important to recognize the difference between ["support" and "optimization"](http://bradfrost.com/blog/mobile/support-vs-optimization/). You should do your best to support as many environments as possible while simultaneously optimizing for the environments that make the most sense for your business and users.

- **What browsers are you *optimizing* for?**
- **What devices are you *optimizing* for?**
- **Are you using a [graded browser support](https://github.com/yui/yui3/wiki/Graded-Browser-Support) system?**
- **Are there specific components that require [more specific grading](https://www.filamentgroup.com/lab/grade-the-components.html)?**
